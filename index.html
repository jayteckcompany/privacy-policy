**JayTeck Universal Privacy Policy**

*Last updated: July 2025*

This privacy policy applies to all software, browser extensions, mobile applications, websites, and digital tools developed and published by **JayTeck** ("we," "us," or "our").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle data across all our products.

---

### 1. Scope

This policy covers all digital products created by JayTeck, including:

* Chrome Extensions
* Mobile Applications (iOS/Android)
* Web Tools or Hosted Apps
* Other downloadable or embedded software

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a product-specific notice, this general privacy policy applies.

---

### 2. Data We Do **Not** Collect

By default, we do **not**:

* Collect personally identifiable information (PII)
* Track user activity or browsing history
* Transmit or store any data off the user’s device
* Use cookies or trackers (unless otherwise disclosed in a specific app)
* Sell, rent, or share user data with third parties

---

### 3. Chrome Extensions

Our browser extensions:

* Do **not** collect, transmit, or store personal or sensitive user data
* Only run in response to **user action** (e.g., clicking a button)
* Access specific pages (e.g., `qbo.intuit.com`) solely for the purpose of reading data visible on-screen
* Operate entirely within the browser and do **not** send data to remote servers

Permissions requested (like `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `host_permissions`) are strictly used to fulfill the intended feature, such as reading values on a page to calculate totals. We do **not** collect or store that data.

---

### 4. Mobile Applications

Unless otherwise disclosed, our mobile apps:

* Do not collect user information
* May request local permissions (e.g., camera or storage) for app functionality only
* Do not send any personal data to external servers
* May use local storage for temporary or offline app functionality

If any app requests analytics, crash reports, or personalized features, it will be clearly disclosed within the app.

---

### 5. Web Tools and Hosted Services

Some of our web tools or hosted apps may:

* Use Google Analytics for aggregate usage insights (non-personal)
* Accept optional form inputs submitted by the user
* Use cookies for session persistence (when applicable)

These tools will display a cookie notice or data collection notice when necessary.

---

### 6. Data Retention

As a general rule, we do **not** store user data. If any of our services do store limited data (e.g. user settings, preferences), it is:

* Stored locally on your device, or
* Anonymized and used only for app performance

---

### 7. Third-Party Services

Some products may integrate with trusted third-party platforms (e.g., Stripe for payments, Lemon Squeezy for licenses). These services have their own privacy policies.

We do **not** control their data handling and recommend reviewing their terms separately.

---

### 8. User Rights

You may:

* Request that we delete any data we’ve stored (if applicable)
* Ask for clarification on what data, if any, we collect in a specific product
* Contact us at any time with privacy concerns (see contact below)

---

### 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as our products evolve. Major changes will be noted in product release notes or posted on our GitHub page.
